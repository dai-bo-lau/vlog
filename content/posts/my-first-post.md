They are a pair of ideal couple. I call them Barbie and Ken and now you should see what I mean. They are my couple slaves. They are obedient, cooperateive and submissive. Yet they always come to me together.

"Master, Ken and I want to have a baby.", Barbie said.

Today we properly dressed, sitting at the Central pier, enjoying the evening sea breeze.

"So... you guys wants to move on?" I said with some hesitation. Yes, we have been in these master-couple-slave relationship for quite a few years. If they want to move on, that could be understood.

Both of them shoke their heads. 

"I want you to impregnate me." Barbie said.

I was shocked.

"Actually it's Ken's idea." said.

"I want to concieve for you, master. But I am a man." Ken said, holding my hand firmly in his.

"So I discussed with Barbie, and we agreed that let Barbie have the baby with you as the biological father is the best way to go." 

I was speechless. Ken and Barbie were important to me, that was for sure. But was it love? or family? or good freinds? or a mixture of all of these?

"I love you. We love you, master." Babie said. Ken nodded his head firmly.
